# Assignment2_ADA
Java program which uses several advance programming algorithms/approaches to tessellate a random irregular polygon.

Users will be shown a GUI which will generate a random pointed irregular polygon based on the number of sides a user selects. All polygon tesslerations are then done preformed via a brute force, greedy, and exact appraoch to find the best (lowest) sum of interior edges. These sums are displayed on the GUI along with the tesserlated polygon.
